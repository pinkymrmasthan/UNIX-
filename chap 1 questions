1. What is register ?

ans:
        A processor register (CPU register) is one of a small set of data holding places that are part of the computer processor.
        A register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any kind of data (such as a bit sequence or individual characters).
        Some instructions specify registers as part of the instruction.

2. How will be data stored in register ?

ans:
        Register is a very fast computer memory,
        used to store data/instruction in-execution.
        A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing one bit of information.
        An n-bit register has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of storing binary information of n-bits.


3. Storange space in register ? Size stored?

ans:
        Registers hold a small amount of data around 32 bits to 64 bits.

Size stored ?

        The size of a register maybe 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits.


4. Type of register ?

ans:
            AC ( accumulator )
            DR ( Data registers )
            AR ( Address registers )
            PC ( Program counter )
            MDR ( Memory data registers )
            IR ( index registers )
            MBR ( Memory buffer registers )


5. high level language , Low level languages ?

ans:
        * They are very easy to understand.
        * Java, C, C++, Python, etc., are a few examples of high-level languages.

Low level languages ?

        * They are also called machine-level languages.
        * They are not portable.
        * These are very difficult to execute.

6. compiler , assembler , assemlly lanauage ?

ans :

compiler:

        So there are many compilers in C like BDS, Clang, GCC, Interactive C, Lattice, Portable C Compiler, Visual Express, etc.

assembler:


        We can write assembly program code inside c language program.
        In such case, all the assembly code must be placed inside asm{} block.

7. what is Translater ?

        Translators are system software that converts programming language code into binary format.
